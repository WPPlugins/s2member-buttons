Add buttons to your toolbar that help you control content presentation in an s2Member based membership site.

== Description ==

s2Member is an awesome free membership site plugin by the folks over at WebSharks / Primo Themes.

While I've been using s2Member on my sites, to make my life easier I built a little complimentary plugin that adds some buttons to the post editing toolbar. 

These buttons can be used to easily add shortcodes into content to control display for user levels.

There are also a couple of extra functions in there too to display EOT (end of term) and list sites a member can access in a multisite network.

The nine toolbar buttons in order are:

* List member's sites - for multisite networks
* Show member EOT
* If logged in
* If not logged in
* If level 1 or above
* If not level 1 or above
* If level 1
* If level 2
* If level 3
* If level 4
* If level 0
* Public

These buttons have been really handy for me, so here they are for any other s2Member users who'd like to have them as well.
